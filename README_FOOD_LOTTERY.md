## Configuration

The `config/config.json` file contains the food preferences for different people:

```json
{
  "people": {
    "Alice": {
      "food_preferences": [
        "Pizza", "Sushi", "Burger", "Pasta", "Tacos",
        "Chinese Stir Fry", "Indian Curry", "Thai Pad Thai"
      ]
    },
    "Bob": {
      "food_preferences": [
        "Steak", "Seafood", "BBQ Ribs", "Sandwich", "Salad",
        "Mexican Burrito", "Korean BBQ", "Italian Risotto"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can easily modify this file to add more people or change food preferences.
